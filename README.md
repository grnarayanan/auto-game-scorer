## Overview

Game scorer offers a simple and effective way of alleviating the need to keep track of the score for a round-based board or card game. No longer do you need to use a piece of paper and calculator to keep score in game of Uno! The user inputs the game to be played, the number of players, and player names. Each round, the user types in what happened in plain english (which players gained/lost points, etc.) An output table with the total score and per round score is produced and displayed for each round.
